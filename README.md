Object Oriented Programming

- This project was developed during my first semester in College, in the Object Oriented Programming module. 
- It was created by me and two other colleagues: Josilene Reis and Jo√£o Vitor Cardoso Viana.
- This assessment was designed to evaluate the learning objectives of the Object Oriented Software Engineering.
- The Agile development methodology was followed to demonstrate the conceptual, practical and technical skills of planning and monitoring a
project plan using an appropriate CASE tool. Also to demonstrate conceptual and technical skills in the analysis, design, implementation and testing
of a software development solution as part of a team. For that, the agile SCRUM method was adopted, and user stories, backlogs and
burndown charts were created. 
- This project contains: 
  -  A use case model contained alternative flow and exceptional flows.
  -  A conceptual class diagram modeling the architecture of the proposed system.
  -  A system sequence diagram of the conceptual class diagram.
  -  The use case Make appointment was chosen to be fully developed in JAVA.  
  -  All classes related to Make appointment use case were created and tested using JUnit testing.
